                <h1>Fitt's Law</h1>
                <p id="wrap">I like how this healthcare web page is simple and to the point. They have simple areas that give you a quick text based summary and then a button. They also have a simple and generic clip art that is nice to see but doesn't really lend to the meaning of the page or what the meaning of the area or button means.</p>

                <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
                <p id="wrap">When you first got to apple.com you see their producsts. Their producsts speak for themself. They do not have very much wording at all. They simply just have pictures of the producsts, then the name, followed by a smaller "learn more" and "buy". I have always loved the simplity of the Apple web pages.</p>

                <h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>
                <p id="wrap">This is a photography web page. The landing is of two girls that is just a little left justifyed. The social media is also left justified at the top but everything else is centered. I just loved how that picture was the first thing that caught your eye and was playing with the rule of thirds.</p>
