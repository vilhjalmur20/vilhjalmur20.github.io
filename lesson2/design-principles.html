                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <p id="wrap">When you first got to apple.com you see their producsts. Their producsts speak for themself. They do not have very much wording at all. They simply just have pictures of the producsts, then the name, followed by a smaller "learn more" and "buy". I have always loved the simplity of the Apple web pages.</p>

                <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
                <p id="wrap">This is a photography web page. The landing is of two girls that is just a little left justifyed. The social media is also left justified at the top but everything else is centered. I just loved how that picture was the first thing that caught your eye and was playing with the rule of thirds.</p>
